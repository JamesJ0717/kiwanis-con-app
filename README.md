# Kiwanis Convention App

This is a website that shows the convention schedule.

## Installing

If you would like to use the same layout, which is mobile-friendly, all you would have to do is update `events.json`, `forums.json`, and `main.md` in the public folder to match what you have planned.

Check the `.env.example` for the other things that need to be changed. This is just small things like the district, dates, and location.

## Usage

Deploy this site to Vercel or any other hosting platform that supports Next.js.
